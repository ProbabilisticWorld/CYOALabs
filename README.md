# Choose your own adventure!

Instead of the prescriptive traditional "cookbook" labs for introductory physics, I use multi-week projects that I call "choose your own adventure" labs. The students are given a very simple prompt (e.g. "Determine a mathematical relationship between the amplitude and period of a pendulum") and design their own experiment. The students have multiple weeks to work through the experimental process including taking preliminary data, identifying sources of error, and refining the experiment.

## About the courses
### [Engineering Physics][Phys25x]
Phys 25x is our Engineering Physics sequence. Calculus III is the math prerequisite for Engineering Physics I.

* Engineering Physics I (Phys 254) is a basic mechanics course
* Engineering Physics II (Phys 255) covers E&M
  * The topics of this course have not lent themselves well to CYOA labs, so I use a mix of one-day activities and multi-day projects
* Engineering Physics III (Phys 256) is a grab-bag of fluids, thermodynamics, optics, sound, waves, and selected topics from modern physics (time-permitting)

### [General Physics][Phys11x]
Phys 11x is our General Physics sequence. Precalculus I: Algebra is the math prerequisite for General Physics I.

* I'm still working on applying CYOA labs to the general physics sequence; I have only made these for General Physics I (Phys 114)
* The biggest challenge to this is that the students simply have less experience with critical thinking
  * I include more instructions/tips/adivce on their lab handouts than I do for the Engineering Physics students
* Some of the labs are still single-week activities
* I receive far more pushback from students who want me to "just tell them what to do" than in the Engineering Physics classes.
* Since calculus is not a requirement for the class, I do not have the students use propagation of error in their analysis; instead I emphasize using large data sets and simple statistical analysis

Questions? Comments? Please get in touch; I really like talking about this stuff.

If you used any of these resources, I'd love to hear about it. How did you use them? What did you change? How did it work out?
