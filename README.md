# Choose your own adventure!

Instead of the prescriptive traditional "cookbook" labs for introductory physics, I use multi-week projects that I call "choose your own adventure" labs. The students are given a very simple prompt (e.g. "Determine a mathematical relationship between the amplitude and period of a pendulum") and design their own experiment. The students have multiple weeks to work through the experimental process including taking preliminary data, identifying sources of error, and refining the experiment.

## About the courses
### [Engineering Physics](Phys25x)
Phys 25x is our Engineering Physics sequence. Calculus III is the math prerequisite for Engineering Physics I.

* Engineering Physics I (Phys 254) is a basic mechanics course
* Engineering Physics II (Phys 255) covers E&M
  * The topics of this course have not lent themselves well to CYOA labs, so I use a mix of one-day activities and multi-day projects
* Engineering Physics III (Phys 256) is a grab-bag of fluids, thermodynamics, optics, sound, waves, and selected topics from modern physics (time-permitting)

### General Physics
Phys 11x is our General Physics sequence. Precalculus I: Algebra is the math prerequisite for General Physics I.

* I'm still working on applying CYOA labs to the general physics sequence; I have only made these for General Physics I (Phys 114)
* The biggest challenge to this is that the students simply have less experience with critical thinking
  * I include more instructions/tips/adivce on their lab handouts than I do for the Engineering Physics students
* Some of the labs are still single-week activities
* I receive far more pushback from students who want me to "just tell them what to do" than in the Engineering Physics classes.
* Since calculus is not a requirement for the class, I do not have the students use propagation of error in their analysis; instead I emphasize using large data sets and simple statistical analysis
