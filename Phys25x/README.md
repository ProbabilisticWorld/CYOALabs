# About the labs in this folder

## [Phys 254][Phys254]
### Project 1: Using density to learn about statistics
Lab for the first two weeks is be more structured than the rest of the quarter. The first week is spent developing a couple of simple experiments and collecting data. I collect each group's results from the first part of the lab before we meet the second week. I compile this to be used in the second part of the project (Statistics).

### Project 2: Drag

This project takes three weeks. I recommend to the students that they spend the first lab period designing an experiment and making preliminary measurements. The following two lab periods should be spent refining the experiments and measurements.

### Project 3: Atwood's machine
This is like a standard Atwood lab, but I let the students figure out how to carry out the experiments. This project will take three weeks.

### Project 4: Coefficient of restitution
The students determine the coefficient of restitution of dynamics carts. I give them two weeks.

## [Phys 255][Phys255]
### Week 1: Charge
This is a one-day exploration of charge; it is similar in spirit to the "Fun with Physics" lab found in the Phys 11x folder.

### Weeks 2 & 3: Mapping electric fields
This is an adaptation of the classic lab where students map electric field lines due to various charge distributions drawn on resistive paper with conductive ink. 

### Week 4: Potentials
This is a one-day activity investigating fields and potentials.

### Week 5: Integration with potentials
Practice using integration to determine the potential due to a continuous charge distribution. I've found that students really benefit from the extra practice session with an instructor in the room to help out when needed. I run this lab similar to how one might run a recitation session.

### Weeks 6 & 7: Ohm's law
Students have a board with a variety of resistance coils.

### Week 8: Mapping magnetic fields
We have large boards (two boards take up nearly an entire lab table) with bar magnets glued underneath in various distributions. The boards are covered in paper so the students do not know how many magnets there are, or how they are arranged.

### Weeks 9 & 10: Homopolar motor 
The students construct and investigate a simple homopolar motor.

## [Phys 256][Phys256]
### Project 1: Practice with uncertainty, propagation of error, and significant figures
This is a single-day activity, designed as a refresher.

### Project 2: Thermal properties of water
This project takes three weeks. Students determine the specific heat, latent heat of fusion, and latent heat of vaporization of water. I recommend to the students that they spend the first two weeks making measurements, and the third week revising/redoing at least one of their experiments to improve their results.

### Project 3: Pendulum periods
I give the students three weeks to determine a what affects a pendulum's period, and in what ways it does so.

### Project 4: Wavelength of laser light
The students have two weeks to measure the wavelength of a HeNe laser. Some students make their own single- or double-slit apparatuses using cardstock.

## Uncertainty
This is a short handout I give the students that covers uncertainty and how I want them to use it in these labs.
