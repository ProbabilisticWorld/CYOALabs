# About the labs in this folder

## Week 1: Fun with physics
This is a one-day exploration of different physics principles that students encounter throughout this course. Information about the "Mystery Tube" can be found in the paper [*Modeling the Nature of Science with the Mystery Tube*, Scott Miller, The Physics Teacher **52**, 548 (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.4902200).

## Weeks 2 & 3: Using density to learn about statistics

In week 2, students do the Density lab. They hand in their data to me before the Week 3 lab, and I compile it into data tables for them to use in Week 3's lab (Statistics)

## Weeks 4--6: Atwood's machine
The traditional Atwood lab tells the students exactly what to do; in my version I give them lots of time to work it out on their own.

## Week 7: Energy and projectiles

This is a single-day activity that is more of a "verification" lab. The students use a short ramp that clamps onto a table to launch a ball horizontally.

## Weeks 8 & 9: Elasticity of collisions

Students determine the coefficient of restitutuion of two colliding dynamics carts.

## Week 10: Equilibrium

This is a straightforward traditional lab; I have not included my handout in this folder

# Uncertainty
This is a short handout I give to the students that covers how I want them to work with uncertainty and significant figures
